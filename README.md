# Introduction
This repo includes some basic algorithm in CS written in C++.
## Graph
* To check if graph contains a cycle: [checkCycle](https://github.com/KevinDeng31/DS-Algo-Cplusplus/blob/master/checkCycle.cpp)
* To compute shortest path: [Dijkstral Algorithm](https://github.com/KevinDeng31/DS-Algo-Cplusplus/tree/master/DijkstralAlgorithm)
